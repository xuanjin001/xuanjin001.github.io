			<p>Not your typical blog...</p>

<p>Let me start with introducing myself first, my name is Xuan Jin. I am from China. I arrived the US in 2010 for my undergraduate education. I went to CSU-Chico from 2010 to 2015. Then I went to University of Pittsburgh from 2018 to 2019 for my master's degree. Between 2016 and 2018, I was working for a company called IGT as a software developer. </p>
  
<p>I have a passion in programming and I also have the eager to learn more about it.  Coding is not only a way to help solving problems, but it can also change your way of thinking in your daily life for sure. </p>
  
<p>I am a bit of a scrappy, I like to learn as I go, and I learn on spot when I need something. My knowledge of different things are pieces of information. It is different from the traditional way of learning. </p>

<br />

<p>Overall, I am using this blog to note down what I learned along the way, and also to track my progress on various of things. I tried to write on Medium, it is simple and straightforward, however, the customization part is not that great. I am building this so that I can cutomize the way I want. I am doing this piece by piece, implementing it little by little. Hope you guys will like it. </p>
