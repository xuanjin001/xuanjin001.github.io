It has been a while for me to write code now, it really depends on what I am currently doing. Ever since I was on this big project last Feb, I have been going non-stop basically. To the point that I really don't want to look at any code related or any work related things, or even a computer screen after work. I really appreciate this opportunity though, I feel like throughout this project, I proved what I am capable of, before I know someone mentioned that "Is she ready?", I have to say, I am more ready and capable than you know. I now know I am more capable than I and other people know.

Alrigt, enough chat, I wanted to give the background of where I am at, I am so out of touch that I didn't even know pipx is the new pip now, and Jupyter hasn't updated their documentation yet, hell, that even popped up when I was trying to install pip through brew on my work computer. It was news to me that we need to use `pipx` now. Then thanks to google, there is a way to install this correctly. I haven't used Jupyter for years, but I think for my side projects, I am going to use Jupyter to clean up the data. Now here is what I found by far.
