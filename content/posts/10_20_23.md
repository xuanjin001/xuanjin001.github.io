I have been writing on wordpress for a long time, a long long long time. LOL. I had all kinds of things on there, it started out as a place I write my diaries, my feelings, the dates that went wrong, then I slowly transferred to professional contents. There are a lot of posts there in wordpress, I will need to export that out and format them to fit for the blog here.

On Hugo website, they provided some ways and tools to do the migration, (here)[https://gohugo.io/tools/migrations/] are what Hugo is talking about.
