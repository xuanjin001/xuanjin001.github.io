I started rewatching TV show, Numbers. It was one of my favorite show back in the days. Solving crimes with math! Come on! Nerds are super heros!

The math theories they mentioned in there are also super intrig to me.

You can also find it online that there are multiple blogs about the show and the theories that mentioned in the show:

Some of those theories, we were learning them during my grad school, math and programming goes hand in hand all the time, a mathmatician can find a pattern in something and have a programmer to create a program to solve those repeated patterns, thus, save time on human redoing the work by hand.

This tv show not only showed how math can help people in daily life, but also helped common people to understand that science is cool. Although, there are a lot of parts in the TV show down played the complexity of everything, but I think it gets the point across. You can read on [Adam's blog](http://www.the-adam.com/adam/numb3rs/one.html) to find the details on this topics.
