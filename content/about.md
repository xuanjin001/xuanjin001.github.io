Hello, my name is Xuan Jin, AKA Shirley.

I have been in the US since 2010, so I have been here for a while.

While you are reading this, in case you still cannot tell, I love gifs lol.

Currently, I am working for RSM as an architect. I see myself as a fixer there, wherever they need someone, I would jump in and help where I can. My specialties are:

-   AWS Connect and anything related to that
-   Salesforce
-   Database & Big data management
-   Learning on spot üòâ

Currently, I want to get back to coding, I haven't been coding for a while, this year 2023, I only just started getting back to coding recently. I have been focusing on myself and getting my life together basically, I started workout again this year, and trying to fit in running here and there. I also have been trying to do more activities and get out more on my free time instead of sitting in front of the computer all the time.

For this blog, I am using [Hugo Theme Coder](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-coder/), I think this time this blog will stay. I have been writing on wordpress, eventually I would want to migrate everything from wordpress to here.

Future plan:

-   Think of more projects I can work on personally
-   Show case projects here on this blog
-   Revisit and pick up python again
-   Looking into data analysis again
-   Look into any open source projects that I could work on

Especially the last point, if anyone know any good project for some newbie like me, please reach out. You can find me at [here](/contact).

Currently, [here](https://github.com/xuanjin001?tab=projects) are the projects I am focusing on. If you have a good project, please reach out, maybe we can work on something together. üòÅ
