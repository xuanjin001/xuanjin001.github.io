      <description>It took me a while to finish the deployment to &amp;ldquo;production&amp;rdquo; which is my github repo.
I would like to document what I was doing here so that I can refer to here later when I need to deploy again.
First of all, I swear there is a cache issue, every time I tried to run it locally, it is running as how I expected, but when I push the changes out to the github pages, it is still the older version, which has been driving me bananas.</description>

      <description>I have been writing on wordpress for a long time, a long long long time. LOL. I had all kinds of things on there, it started out as a place I write my diaries, my feelings, the dates that went wrong, then I slowly transferred to professional contents. There are a lot of posts there in wordpress, I will need to export that out and format them to fit for the blog here.</description>

      <description>My blog post project Link to heading I have been writing on wordpress for a while now, on and off, I have been on wordpress for about 15 years. I still need to move everything from there to here. However, I am not waiting until I get everything sorted out before I start on something. I am going to get things started instead.
Wordpress is great, I can focus on the content, however, there are some things I don&amp;rsquo;t like about it.</description>
