      <description>It has been a while for me to write code now, it really depends on what I am currently doing. Ever since I was on this big project last Feb, I have been going non-stop basically. To the point that I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to look at any code related or any work related things, or even a computer screen after work. I really appreciate this opportunity though, I feel like throughout this project, I proved what I am capable of, before I know someone mentioned that &amp;ldquo;Is she ready?</description>
