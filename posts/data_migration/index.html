			<p>So yes, data migration, it is necesary but it is definitely NOT FUN. Is there anything we can help to make that process more smooth? Maybe.</p>
<p>During my projects, I have done couple data migrations now. Each of them are different I would definitely say that, however, I also noticed a pattern. Here is what I found. Before I go ahead and share my &ldquo;secrets&rdquo;, I need to make something clear. I am doing data migration from other system into Salesforce. The challenge of that is the format of the data in the other system is different from how Salesforce would accept, and we also need to understand the data structure in order to import the data. The hardest part is there is no one size fits all, so we have to do that part manually.</p>
<p>Data migration might be a term a lot of developers don&rsquo;t hear about. This mostly apply to some legacy system. When you want to move from one system to another, you need to move the data also. For a lot of web companies or internet companies, this is not a huge problem, because they are starting out with an app from ground up, so their database is already there, and for most of the time, they have their database setup right. (&ndash;&gt; Tree structure, the whole reason why a lot of programming interviews touches this, and also when I normally fail. Haha, we will get to this later. ) They will mostly only need to focus on how to build functions to provide a better user exerpiences to their users. The hard part of the ERP or legacy system related projects is you have all the problems you may face compare to just develop an App, but at the same time, you also have a lot of other things you need to consider, such as you need to understand how each system functions and how they have been integrated with each other; you also need to take in consideration of how each database is functioning, since each system has different databases, and data migration is taking data from one system and formatted into a format that another system can recognize. Data is the center of everything, no doubt, even you have an app, you need a database also, without data, you have nothing.</p>
<p>The function of database is to format data in a way so that later on when you need the data, you can extract the information efficiently. This applies to any system and app, this is also the reason why algorithm is cruicial when comes to coding. It helps with the efficiency of getting the data, even for the users it might just be couple seconds of difference, but it is crucial still. It not only affects the performance of a page but also it affects the user experience. Imagine this, you are browsing on internet, and you clicked a button to get a report or some sort, and that takes 10 seconds, 10 seconds sounds like short, but try to time it on your own, you will be surprised as how long that is. 10 seconds is actully a long time. Now taking that into page loading and you can tell how frustrated a user would be when a page doesn&rsquo;t load. Haha. Don&rsquo;t throw your computer though! LOL</p>
<p>Back to Data Migration, no one likes it, but it is necessary and rather really important part of it as well. A lot of testing needs to be done before-hand, and you have to develop different procedure for different projects, as each company function differently and also they have different purposes for using different things. The strategy we took has been manually check the data, so users will get the data out of their old systems, and we will take a look at them to make sure that that data can be accepted by Salesforce, if there are some serious errors we catch before we load the data, we will push the data back to the users for them to fix. Serious errors means that some required fields values are missing, for example, in Contact, you know Last Name is a required field, but in the data field that&rsquo;s missing, there is no point to load the data, cause we know it is going to fail. After they get the data back to us, we will go over that again to see if any of the important data is missing, then load it. When loading the data, you will get the feedback, with the feedback, you would know exactly why this insert failed, the only problem is those errors only shows the first error they got, it will pile on later on, but there is a chance you need to load the data multiple times to get all of the data in. The process of this is tedious.</p>
<p>The process of the data migration is simple, I mean it is necessary, it is essential, but it is also lacking of specialty, anyone can come in and pick this up, I don&rsquo;t mind doing this but honestly, if I continue to do it, I am really worried about where my future would be. Cause like what I said, anyone can pick it up and do this, so I am replacable, whenever I am doing a job, trying to learn a skill, I always look at the perspective of two things. One is it transferable? Two can it help me as well as helping the company to develop further?</p>
<p>Salesforce related skills in general is a niche to be starting with, the skill set is so limited to that platform alone, there is a whole world outside of it. I heard couple people talking about how much they hate to setup develop environment and how Salesforce already established that, which in a way it is great, but you also need to take under consideration that you are replacable too. People with a programming background, computer science background, they understand how system working better than you, and they are also better at picking up a programming language, they can pick up any programming language, so when comes to hiring, why they would want to hire someone specifically only have the skills dedicating to Salesforce, at the same time they can hire someone with a computer science background and possibly they can be placed in any position because their background. The utilization of the computer science background candidate is more. There are debating going on about this, and this is just my opinion. Let me know what you think! I would love to talk to more people about this.</p>
