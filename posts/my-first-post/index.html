			<p>As my first post, I want to talk about how I created this blog. There were definitely ups and downs. I cannot deny that, also there were frustrations.</p>
<p>Overall, I love this framework. I have searched online and see what frameworks are out there. The ones I looked at are Hugo and Hex, Hex seems to have more documentation on how each framework works and how you can utilize them. There is a huge community support as well. It is really great, however, most of the community support are in foreign language, and the amount that you can customize is a little limited. I also took a look at Hugo. Now, Hugo is different. It is powered by Go in the back-end. Go is an open source language, and it is really fast. This also result in that this that this framework works really fast. You can find out more about Go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)">here</a></p>
<p>For this blog, I did the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First of the FIRST: I went to read the documentation, that should be everyone&rsquo;s first step, a good program should also come with a handy documentation. In the documentation, they explained how you can set up the environment, and how you can use this framework. <a href="https://gohugo.io/about/">Documentation</a></p>
<p>When I was reading other blogs, I saw couple comments saying that Hugo doesn&rsquo;t have enough documentation or explainations. When I first started out, the documentation is simple and straight-forward. HOWEVER, I have to say a BIG HOWEVER, there are a lot of things that&rsquo;s not included in the documentation, you really have to hunt for it. For example, I followed the steps to set up the environment, that part was easy, but when I picked a theme and trying to customize the theme to make it to be fit for me, and more having a feeling for me. I was having a hard time to figure out how to do the customization. I guess what I read was right, it is hard to figure something out, but that&rsquo;s also part of programmer&rsquo;s life, isn&rsquo;t it? You have a problem, you find a solution to resolve it. This post really helped me out, after I was stuck for a couple of days, I step upon this which totally helped me figure out how to fix the problem I have! Here is the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/your-first-hugo-blog-a-practical-guide/">blog</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let me explain the issues. The theme I picked is &lsquo;monopriv&rsquo;. It has 4 buttons on top of the page, where it says &ldquo;Home&rdquo;, &ldquo;About&rdquo;, &ldquo;Blog&rdquo;, &ldquo;Tags&rdquo;. I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how everything is linked together. My first thought was, this definitely has something to do with &ldquo;router&rdquo;, which I absolutely hate. When I was trying to figure out Vue, I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how all of the pages were linked, this has always been my problem. I am relatively new to the whole front-end piece, to be honest, but I am catching up. If you have been in this industry long enough, you would know that there is a magic thing called &ldquo;Inspect Elements&rdquo;!!! I still remember the first time, I actually understand this, it is just amazing! You can use it to find the EXACT element on your page, and you can even try to modify on the spot to see the changes, then change that in your code. I mean testing for front-end does takes a lot of time and it could get really annoying, but trust me, in the end it will be all worth it! So that&rsquo;s how I found out that the original theme was having a direct link for those buttons. However, I couldn&rsquo;t understand where are they hosting those pages. This is where the blog I mentioned earlier comes in, it mentioned that, they are hosting everything under the &ldquo;content&rdquo; folder. AND that worked!!! Everything just fall through later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another wall I hit was to run this on a github hosting. THANKS to google, you will need to first deploy in your local environment, then push the changes into your github page.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="steps">Steps:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Install Hugo</li>
<li>Create a New Site</li>
<li>Add a Theme</li>
<li>Add some content (only the blog posts)</li>
<li>Start Hugo Server</li>
<li>Customize the Theme</li>
<li>Build basic static pages
All of the above steps you can find more details <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">here</a></li>
<li>Cd into the public folder</li>
<li>push those changes into github pages</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end, this is really easy to set up, and your blog will come out beautiful.</p>
<p>You should give it a try!!</p>
