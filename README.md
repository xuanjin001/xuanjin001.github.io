# Overview

This is an overview of my personal blog and keep track of how this is built.

This is a reference to https://napsterinblue.github.io/

I stumbled upon Nick's blog while I was doing some research on AI and machine learning, and how to deal with data properly. I fell in love with his blog format. I have been wanting to find a format that would work for me. Some are too simplistic, some are too complex, some are adding too much stuff. I also tried to build it on my own, but I have tried different designs, I couldn't figure out one that I actually like. Nick's blog is just about right. Nick's blog is a place to host his journals without any ads, and it is a place where he can host his notes, and what he learned over the years, on top of that he also get to showcase what he has been working on.

I have been using wordpress to write my blogs and host different kind of items. https://xjin2.wordpress.com/

I have been writing on wordpress for about 15 years. Throughout the years, I have been rearranging this blogs to make it fit for my current use. The pro of it is, it is easy to use, but the downside is there are couple limits, and for a lot of people there are a lot of ads if you are using the free version of the wordpress; which is annoying and could be disruptive while you are reading.

Now let's give this a try, shall we.
